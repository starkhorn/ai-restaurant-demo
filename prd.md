### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1 Overview**
This document defines the scope and details of the "Restaurant Menu & Order Management System," a web-based platform designed to digitize the in-restaurant ordering process. Customers can view the menu and place orders directly from their table using their smartphones, and orders are transmitted to the kitchen in real-time. This system aims to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and elevate the customer experience.

#### **1.2 Problem Statement**
The traditional restaurant ordering process often faces several challenges:
* **Delays:** Customers experience long waits for staff to take their orders, especially during peak hours.
* **Errors:** Manual order-taking can lead to communication errors between the customer, waitstaff, and kitchen.
* **Menu Management:** Updating physical menus (e.g., price changes, sold-out items) is difficult and costly.
* **Staff Workload:** Staff spend a significant amount of time taking and relaying orders instead of focusing on other service aspects.

#### **1.3 Goals/Objectives**
* **Reduce customer waiting time** for placing an order by at least 50%.
* **Minimize order errors** to a negligible level (Target < 1%).
* **Improve communication efficiency** between customers and the kitchen.
* **Increase customer satisfaction** through a modern and seamless ordering experience.
* **Increase table turnover rate.**

#### **1.4 User Personas**
1.  **Customer:** A diner at the restaurant who wants convenience, speed, and accuracy when ordering food.
2.  **Kitchen Staff:** An employee responsible for preparing food who needs clear, real-time, and sequential orders.
3.  **Cashier:** An employee responsible for billing who needs an accurate summary of each table's charges.
4.  **Restaurant Manager/Owner:** An individual who manages the menu, oversees restaurant operations, and wants a system to streamline the business.

### **2. Scope & Features**

#### **2.1 Core Features**

**2.1.1 Digital Menu Management**
* **Description:** The restaurant manager can create and manage the food menu through a backend system.
* **User Story:** "As a restaurant manager, I want to add, edit, and delete menu items and categories, so that our menu is always up-to-date."
* **Requirements:**
    * An Admin Panel for menu management.
    * Ability to create/edit/delete **food categories** (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Drinks).
    * When adding/editing a menu item, the following fields must be available:
        * Item Name (Thai/English)
        * Short Description
        * Price
        * Item Image (file upload)
        * Category
        * Status (Available / Temporarily Sold Out)
    * The manager can instantly change an item's status to "Temporarily Sold Out," which will prevent customers from ordering it.

**2.1.2 Customer QR Code Ordering**
* **Description:** Customers scan a QR code at their table to access the digital menu and place an order themselves.
* **User Story:** "As a customer, I want to scan a QR code at my table to view the menu and order from my phone immediately for convenience and speed."
* **Requirements:**
    * The system must be able to generate a unique QR code for each table.
    * Scanning the QR code opens the web-based menu and automatically identifies the table number.
    * The menu must have a responsive design that displays well on mobile devices.
    * Customers can browse the menu by category.
    * Customers can select items, adjust quantities, and add them to an "Order Cart."
    * Include a field for **"Special Requests"** for each item (e.g., "not spicy," "no cilantro").
    * Customers can review all items in their cart before confirming the order.
    * Upon confirmation, the order is sent to the system instantly.

**2.1.3 Instant Kitchen Order Transmission**
* **Description:** Confirmed customer orders appear on a screen in the kitchen immediately.
* **User Story:** "As a kitchen staff member, I want to see new orders appear on the Kitchen Display System (KDS) in real-time, so I can start preparing them sequentially and quickly."
* **Requirements:**
    * A dedicated Kitchen Display System (KDS) screen that shows incoming orders.
    * Orders are displayed chronologically.
    * Each order "ticket" must clearly show:
        * Table Number
        * Time of Order
        * List of items and quantities
        * Special requests (if any)
    * An audible or visual alert signals the arrival of a new order.

**2.1.4 Order Status Notification**
* **Description:** Kitchen staff can update the status of an order, and the customer sees this update on their phone.
* **User Story (Kitchen):** "As a kitchen staff member, I want to press a button to change an item's status from 'Cooking' to 'Ready to Serve' to notify other staff."
* **User Story (Customer):** "As a customer, I want to see the status of my ordered items (e.g., Cooking, Ready to Serve), so I can know what to expect."
* **Requirements:**
    * On the KDS, kitchen staff can change the status of individual **food items**, not just the entire order.
    * Initial statuses include:
        * **Queued**: The initial state when an order is received.
        * **Cooking**
        * **Ready to Serve**
    * On the customer's device, the status of their ordered items updates in real-time based on changes made by the kitchen.
    * (Optional) A notification system could be implemented for waitstaff when an item is "Ready to Serve."

**2.1.5 Billing & Checkout**
* **Description:** The cashier can retrieve a summary of all items and the total bill for each table to process payment.
* **User Story:** "As a cashier, when a customer provides their table number for payment, I want to see a complete list of what their table ordered and the final bill, so I can collect payment accurately."
* **Requirements:**
    * A dedicated interface for the cashier.
    * The cashier can search for an order using the **table number**.
    * The system will display all items, quantities, price per unit, and the grand total for that table.
    * The system must support adding new orders to an existing table's bill (for second or third rounds of ordering).
    * After payment is complete, the cashier can "Close Table" or "Clear Bill," making the table available for the next customer.
